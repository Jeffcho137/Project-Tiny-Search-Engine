# CS50 TSE LAB 6 Querier Module
This module reads in a query from the user, then searches documents to find whichever satisfy the query the greatest.

## Usage
* `To build -> make querier`

* `To test -> make test (Assumption that there has been a crawler file already made as well as an index in order for querier to function)`

* `To clean up -> make clean`

## Notes
`The querier module is used to handle queries from the user and find relevant documents. My program meets the full spec requirements`
